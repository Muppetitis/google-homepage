This is my first git project. 
So far topics covered include - CSS basics, browser element inspectors and basic git setup.
The project was to create a reasonable likeness of the Google search page as part of the learning program on The Odin Project.
As this was my first project and being a complete coding novice, this took me some time, reading many tutorials and learning from the many different ways other people have coded this task and adapting and figuring it out to get to how I've style the page to a place where I'm happy with it.
