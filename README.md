This is my first git project. 
So far topics covered include - CSS basics, browser element inspectors and basic git setup.
The project was to create a reasonable likeness of the Google search page as part of the learning program on The Odin Project.
As this was my first project and being a complete coding novice, this took me some time. From reading many tutorials and learning from the many different ways other people have coded this task has helped me adapt and figure out how to code this to the end result I have here.
